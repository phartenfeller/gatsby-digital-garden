# Gatsby Philipps Foam Theme

My customized Gatsby theme specifically for [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

Forked from [mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden) who did all the major work, many thanks to him!

Changes made to original:

- Codeblocks with Codemirror 6
- Upped deps (Gatsby 3)
- Adopted Tailwind for styles
- Dropped roam support (check [mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden) if you need it)

Planned:

- Change graph diagram (redo with `@antv/g6`)
- More themes and some style changes
- Small table of contents at frame header (like GitHub has now)
